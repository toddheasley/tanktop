# Tanktop

Tanktop is an easy way to keep track of your [Tank Utility](https://www.tankutility.com)-monitored oil or propane tank(s) from an iPhone or iPad. Includes adjustable tank level notifications and a watch app with complications for Infograph and Infograph Modular watch faces.

If you don’t have a Tank Utility monitor for your oil or propane tank — or you don’t have an oil or propane tank at all — this app is completely useless to you. However, there is a dummy account that you can view using the email address `tanktop@example.com` and any non-empty string as a password.

## `TankUtility`

Behind the scenes, Tanktop uses the included [`TankUtility`](TankUtility) framework, a lightweight Cocoa wrapper for the [Tank Utility API.](http://apidocs.tankutility.com)

## Requirements

`Tanktop` is written in [Swift 5](https://docs.swift.org/swift-book) and requires [Xcode](https://developer.apple.com/xcode) 10.2 or newer to build.
