# Tanktop

Tanktop is an easy way to keep track of your [Tank Utility](https://www.tankutility.com)-monitored oil or propane tank(s) from an iPhone or iPad. Includes adjustable tank level notifications and a watch app with complications for Infograph and Infograph Modular watch faces.

If you don’t have a Tank Utility monitor for your oil or propane tank — or you don’t have an oil or propane tank at all — this app is completely useless to you. However, there is an example account that you can view using the email address `tanktop@example.com` and any non-empty string as a password.

## `TankUtility`

Tanktop relies on the included [`TankUtility`](TankUtility) Swift package, which wraps the [Tank Utility API.](http://apidocs.tankutility.com)
